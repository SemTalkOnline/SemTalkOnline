## Naming Task Objects Using Vocabulary

In addition to naming **Task Objects** by:
1.  Double-clicking on the **Object**,
2.  Right mouse click - **Properties** 

SemTalk Online also has the **Vocabulary** structured **Task** naming option comprised of **Objects** (nouns) and **Methods** (verbs). 

When **Tasks** are named using **Vocabulary**, picklists are shown with all available **Object** and **Method** names. Users can choose from the picklist or, if the Objects are not in the picklist, they can add additional **Objects** and **Methods** to the picklist for future use. This is keeps the **Vocabulary** used in the model consistent.

For example, the process 'Send Invoice' consists of the **Method** 'Send' and the **Object** 'Invoice'. When **Gatesways** are used **Vocabulary** is comprised of **Objects** and [**States**](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/State). 

**Vocabulary** naming creates model-specific Libraries of these verbs, nouns and states that can be saved by the Model Administrator into the central Repositories that is used by all organizational modeling teams. Not only is the naming process consistent, interfaces that define information flows between different models also remain consistent allowing key model terms to be easily linked or imported and exported.

Right-mouse click on a new Task and select **Vocabulary**.

A **Vocabulary** Window will open with pull-down lists of available **Objects** (Nouns) and **Methods** (Verbs) / **States** (status) currently in the [Repository](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/Repository). As new **Object**, **Method** and **State** names are added, they will automatically be added to the [Repository](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/Repository).
