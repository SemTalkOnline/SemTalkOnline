**General - Name**: **Object** names must consist of letters and numbers. Other characters (e.g. periods, slashes, underscores, colons, etc.) are not allowed. 
When you name an **Object**, after dragging and dropping it onto a **Diagram**, the name you gave the Object will automatically be added to the **Properties** Name.

**General - Index**: This is the Task Index number for the Object as it related to other Task Objects. SemTalk automatically assigns an Index number but this number can be edited to correspond existing organizational indexing numbers.

**General - Comment**: Comments can be added to Objects. Connect the Comment Object to the Task that contains a Comment to see the Comment on your Diagram.
