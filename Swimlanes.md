**Swimlanes and Pools** are used to display processes structured according to processing units. This practice originates from BPMN Notations and is generally used there. However in SemTalk Swimlanes are available for other notations, e.g. EPK.

Further distinction is made between:<BR>
**Pool:** represent greater organisations, e.g. Corporations or entire departments. A Pool comprises multiple Swimlanes.<BR>
**Swimlanes:** represent processors. These can be, depending on the level of detail, persons, roles or smaller organisational units.

A Pool with the organisation "Semtation" includes in the example two Swimlanes ("IT department" and "Aquisition").

A single Swimlane.

**Swimlanes and Pools** can be created by:
* Dragging and dropping a Swimlane object from your stencil icons, 
* Right mouse clicking on an existing Swimlane. In the context menu Swimlane --> New
* In the main menu "Process" --> Swimlane --> New

Swimlanes can be displayed **vertical or horizontal**. "Horizontal" is the default setting. There are the two following options, to switch to "vertical":

* right click on a existing Swimlane. In context menu Swimlane --> vertical  
* in main menu "Process" --> Swimlane --> vertical

Swimlanes are collaps- and expandable:

* right click on a existing Swimlane. In context menu Swimlane --> expand or collapse
* in main menu "Process" --> Swimlane --> expand or collapse

**Caution:** If a Swimlane gets deleted, all its contained shapes will be deleted aswell.
