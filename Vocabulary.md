In addition to the two Object naming options:
1.  Double-click on the Object,
2.  Right mouse click on the Object and select Properties and enter the Object name in the Task dialog, 

SemTalk is also able to create structured naming conventions using the Vocabulary function found in the object's right-click menu. Almost all processes (work-steps) have names that consist of a verb and a noun. For example, the process step 'Send Invoice' is the verb 'Send' and the noun 'Invoice'. 

[States](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/State) are used when naming Gateways using Vocabulary. Here the State of an Object is relavant when determining what the next step is in a workflow. SemTalk allows users to create libraries of these verbs, nouns and States so that modeling projects remain consistent; interfaces that define information flows remain consistent; and so that central repositories of terms can be created that allow modelers to import/ export/ share key data terms to and from these libraries.

Right-mouse click on a new Task and select Vocabulary.

A Vocabulary Window will open. Available Objects (Nouns) and Methods (Verbs) names from the associated [Repository](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/Repository) will be shown in pull-down menu. As you add new Object and Method names, they will be automatically added to the [Repository](https://github.com/SemTalkOnline/SemTalkOnline/wiki/Repository).

Users can also directly create names in the Repository by clicking on an blank space and choosing from the existing Objects or Methods.
