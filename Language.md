There are two primary Language setting types in SemTalk.
* GUI Language: The SemTalk User Interface Language
* Language: The model content Language for model Viewers

Object Names are always automatically mapped to the currently selected Language setting. If you change Languages, new Objects are mapped to the currently selected Language and existing Object Names will retain the last Name given in the previously selected Language. When you change the Task Name to the Name used in the currently selected Language, the Name will be mapped to the currently selected Language. When you reselect the first language from the Language pull-down menu, the Name will change back to the name that was assigned when the object was named in the that Language setting.

**NOTE**: This mapping also occurs if naming was done using Vocabulary naming, but noun and verb are translated separately.

Language settings are found in:
* SemTalk Settings: Both the GUI Language and the Model Language setting. Click on the gear button to the right of your pull-down menu, to access Language settings
* Language pull-down menu: This is used to select the model content Language. The languages that are listed are those where basic SemTalk component names are coded into SemTalk. 
* Select Object and go to the Object - Change Class - Language pull-down menu. 

If you use the Vocabulary naming functionality, it is necessary to create multiple models, each with its own unique language-specific Repository. A higher level model can be created that contains links to each of the language-specific models.
