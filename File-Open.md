# File - Open

**File Open** opens a directory of available Models. If you open a model that is checked out by another user, you will see a red error message next to the model name in your Explorer stating that the model is checked out to 'User X'. You can use the Save As command to create a new version of the model or, if you are a model Administrator, you can check the model back in.

The **Open** command shows a list of an organization's **Database** models and  when **Local** is selected, it shows the models that are stored locally on your computer. 

When selecting **Database** models, SemTalk Online automatically updates associated data such as the date last **Modified**, the last author in **ModifiedBy** and the **CheckOut** status.

The following example shows a red star next to the TradeShowDemo model to show that it is **Checked Out** along with status information such as **Last Modified** Date and who it was **Modified By**.
