**File Open**

**File Open** opens a directory of available Models. If you open a model that is checked out by another user, you will see a red error message next to the model name in your Explorer stating that the model is checked out to <user x>. You can use the Save As command to create a new version or, if you are a model Administrator, you can check the model back in.

Available files are stored locally, on your **Computer**. Available SemTalk online files are located by selecting from the local and **Database** list that appears when you select **Open**. When selecting Database models, SemTalk automatically updates associated data such as the date last **Modified**, the last author in **ModifiedBy** and the **CheckOut** status.

The following example shows that the TradeShowDemo model is **Checked Out** status designated by the red star, the **Last Modified** Date and who it was **Modified By**.
