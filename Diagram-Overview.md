**Diagrams**

Every model requires a workspace on which to model. In SemTalk, these workspaces are referred to as Diagrams. SemTalk simplifies the modeling process by creating modeling workspaces that have the rules built into the modeling environment. The number and type of Diagrams, as well as the modeling rules, correspond to each of the standard SemTalk versions.  Each time you open a SemTalk version, whether it is BPMN, EPCs or any customized version type, you are opening a worksheet that comes with a set of Diagram types, each with their own built-in rule-based engine that will only allow the Objects and Associations applicable to the selected version. User-defined Diagrams can also be created but  reporting and other functions may be limited without additional customization.

In the SemTalk GUI, the Diagram is the active modeling space where users add work and information flows; create Object scenarios; and add OrgCharts to show who does what.

* Business Process Diagrams

* OrgChart

EPC Diagram Types:
* Buffer Model
