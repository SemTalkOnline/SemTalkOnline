SemTalkÂ® is a tool for business process modeling and ontology editing. SemTalk is designed to manage process knowledge, both in terms of workflows and in terms of identifying and providing metadata for documents and other content-related needs such as portals and smart forms.

SemTalk models are built using the following components:
* Pull-Down Menu
* Window Panels
* Zoom Window
* Drag & Drop Objects Panel
* Diagrams
* Objects that contain: 
   * Properties
   * Connectors
**Diagrams**: Diagrams are the active modeling pages. Each diagram types is associated with **Objects** and rules appropriate for the active diagram. The types of **Diagrams** available are determined by the currently used SemTalk version. 
For example, a generic BPML version contains the following **Diagram** types:
* Business Process Diagram
* Object Diagram
* Ontology
* OrgChart


Business Process Diagrams contain:
* Business Objects with their associated Property information, 
* Connections between business objects, 
* Methods, 
* States,
* Attributes associated with Objects, 
* Annotation Objects (freely definable explanatory text and links), and
* Bi-directional interfaces to key applications and databases

In addition to standard SemTalk versions, it is also possible to purchase customization services to tailor templates to specific methodologies or unique needs.  

In addition to model components presented in a graphical format, SemTalk also has navigational components designed to optimize content access making it easy to find and modify content if necessary.  Central object libraries are shared in **Repositories** that are available for other projects or other SemTalk versions types. If central **Repository** changes are made, they will then be propagated to all linked templates. Core **Object** information is generally pre-defined and edited within the **Repository** defined by the customized template, linked databases or from standard applications such as Microsoft SharePoint. **Object Attributes** located in the **Repository** are also imported, or they can be independently defined by users. Customized models can also be bi-directionally linked to core applications such as Microsoft Teams. Additionally, there are numerous interfaces and built-in standard and customizable reports and analyses.
