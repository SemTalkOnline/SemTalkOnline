# Shapes

The **Shape Pull-Down Menu** is where the appearance and placement of Shapes is managed. It is also used to add, delete and edit non-SemTalk Object GUI Shapes that are added as visual aids to help model viewers to better understand the model information.

## Shape Pull-Down Menu

**NOTE**: If a SemTalk Object Shape is not first selected, pull-down settings will add, delete and edit non-SemTalk Object GUI Shapes. If a SemTalk Object is selected, the Shape pull-down menu will create, edit and manage SemTalk Object Shape data.
