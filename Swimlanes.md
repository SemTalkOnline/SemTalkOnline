**Swimlane**: **Swimlanes** are used to show how workflows flow through different organizational or technical channels. Each **Swimlane** represents a different person, group, technology or location. Tasks and resources located in those **Swimlanes** represents the organizational or technical channel's work and resources. 

**Swimlanes** can be created by:
* Dragging and dropping a Swimlane object from your stencil icons, 
* Right mouse clicking on an existing Swimlane and selecting New or by,
* Selecting New from the Process - Swimlane - New pull-down menu.

* **New**: Creating **Swimlanes** is an iterative process. The representation of **Swimlanes** in SemTalk Online is based on the principles of the BPMN methodology. A Business Process Diagram's default setting is to show the highest level **Swimlane** on the Business Process Diagram. When you select **Process - Swimlane - New**, a new **Sub-Swimlane** will be created. Additional Sub-Swimlanes

* **Vertical**: **Swimlanes** can be shown vertically or horizontally. Once this setting has been selected, it in not possible to revert back to the other setting. 
* **Expand** and **Collapse**: Shows or hides swimlanes to allow users to show the flows between specific swimlane tasks.
* **Plus/Minus button**: This button is a short-cut to **Expand or Collapse Swimlanes**.

Once a **Swimlane** has been created, if you delete the **Swimlane**, it will delete all of the objects in the **Swimlane** in your model. Those objects will continue to remain in the **Repository**.
