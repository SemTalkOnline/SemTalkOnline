The SemTalk user interface is comprised of:

**Pull-down menu bar**: Contains all available SemTalk Commands 

**Zoom Window**: Navigation tool for each Diagram

Diagram window: Diagrams are SemTalk's modeling workspaces where Objects and their relationships are drawn. Available Diagram types are determined by the methodology associated with the Model type selected.  There are different types of available Diagrams for each SemTalk version. For example, if BPMN is selected, Business Process Diagram, Object, Ontology and Org Chart diagrams are available.

Object Panel: This panel has all the available objects for the currently selected diagram. 

Swimlanes are generally included as a default when modeling using the BPMN template. This helps to visualize who does what and the handoffs between groups.
