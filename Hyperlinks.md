# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks allow additional internal and external information to be integrated into a Diagram. This increases the ability of the model to be better understood and it allows the integrations of existing documentation and forms.

**Address**: URL Link

**Diagram**: If a model contains more than one **Diagram**, another **Diagram** within the model can be referenced as a **Hyperlink**.

**SemTalk File**: Instead of a URL, a *.sdx file document can be linked to allow different models to be linked together.

**Label**: The Hyperlink Name that will be shown in the model instead of the URL.

**Icon**: An image that can be clicked on to opens the URL.

**Language**: Used to designate if the Hyperlink should be shown in the currently selected Language setting. Different URLs can be used for different language settings.
