## Stencil
The Stencil window contains the Objects that can be dragged and dropped into the open Diagram. 

The graphical Objects shown in the Stencil are determined by the selected SemTalk Online version in use (e.g. BPMN, EPC ...) and the currently opened Diagram Type (e.g. Process Diagram, Object Diagram, OrgChart...) . 

The Stencil can be shown or hidden using the **View - Stencil** pull-down menu.
