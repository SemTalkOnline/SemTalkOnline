**File Open**: Opens a selectable list of all available models along with their CheckIn/ CheckOut status. If you open a model that is checked out by another user, you will see a red error message next to the model name in your Explorer stating that the model is checked out to <user x>. 

Save As creates a new model version or it allows model Administrators to check the model back in. Files are either stored locally on your **Computer** or they are selected via the available  **Database** model list. When selecting Database models, SemTalk automatically updates associated data such as the date last **Modified**, the last author in **ModifiedBy** and the **CheckOut** status. Files can be selected by Name, Date, and Last Modified status.
