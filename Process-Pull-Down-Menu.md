The Process pull-down menu allows you to manage key process-related model components:

Vocabulary: Almost all processes (work-steps) have names that consist of a verb and a noun. For example, the process step 'Send Invoice' is the verb 'Send' and the noun 'Invoice'. SemTalk allows users to create libraries of these verbs and nouns so that modeling projects remain consistent; interfaces that define information flows remain consistent; and so that central repositories of terms can be created that allow modelers to import/ export/ share key data terms to and from these libraries.

Swimlane: Swimlanes are used to show how workflows flow through different organizational or technical channels. Each Swimlane represents a different person, group, technology or location. Tasks and resources in those Swimlanes represent the work and resources of that unit.
