# Navigator Tool

![alt text](images/Navigator.png)

The Navigator tool reads the Task Object’s name and the Task sequence out loud. Navigator arrows determine how the process flow should be read. Up and down reads the steps between Refinements and higher-level processes. Left and right arrows read the process flow forwards or backwards on the current Diagram.
