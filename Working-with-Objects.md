**Working with Objects**

SemTalk Online is built on object-oriented modeling concepts. Most model elements are created as Objects that can be used multiple times, in various places. Object-oriented modeling also allows modeling elements to be managed centrally. This has many advantages. Properties assigned to objects are also found in all instances of the objects used. Associated properties include information such as Comments, Attributes, or embedding links to Object information in other languages. Object-oriented concepts also minimize redundancies such as modeling the same objects using different names. , as all modelers can refer to existing objects.

These object-based elements include, among others:
* Roles/process participants (BPMN)
* Systems/data storage (BPMN)
* Data objects (BPMN)
* Organizational units
* Services (EPC)
* Material resources (EPC)
* Class (EPC)
* Technical terms (EPC)

There are a few things to keep in mind when working with objects:

**Create an Object**:
* Drag and drop Objects from the Stencil
* Import Objects from Excel or from a Repository

**Name an Object**:
* Double click on the Object, 
* Open the Object's right-mouse click menu
* Use the Vocabulary naming option 

**Connect Objects**:  
* Hover your cursor over the center of an Object until the hand icon appears. Hold down your cursor and draw the connection to the next object. 
* Right mouse on an Object and select a target Object

Connection types are dependent on the Diagram type. Users are able to create user-defined connectors but it is generally not recommended because user-defined connectors are not considered when running process flow consistency checks.
