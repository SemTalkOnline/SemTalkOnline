Semtation GmbH develops and distributes SemTalkÂ®, a tool for business process modeling and ontology editing. Based on more than 20 years of experience, we support our customers in managing their process knowledge, both in terms of workflows and in terms of identifying and providing metadata for documents and other content.

Semtation GmbH provides the tool and supports the customers in the implementation and, if required, also in further support in the context of document indexing or process management for a more effective and optimised workplace.

Our goal is to enable our customers to manage their corporate knowledge and to use process management as a sustainable tool for shaping their processes.
