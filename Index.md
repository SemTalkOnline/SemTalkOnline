SemTalk allows Indexing of Tasks. When selected, Index numbers are assigned automatically to Tasks and Subtasks as they are created. The default setting is standard numerical nomenclature (e.g. 1, 1.1, 1.1.1). However, indices are simple text fields that can be customized to conform to pre-existing or specialized alpha-nummeric indexing requirements.

Activate the Indexing function:

* Select a Task from your model,
* Select **Object - Customize - Label - Index** from the Object pull-down menu

Edit Index numbers by selecting a Task Object and selecting Properties. Reorder all Index numbers by selecting the highest level Task and assign the number '1'. If Task indexing needs to conform to a prexisting indexing system, just add the alpha-numberic name to each Task object in **Properties - Index**. If alpha characters are used, the name must include a number at the end of the name to be able to assign Subtasks to Tasks and to show sequencing.

Index numbers are shown in the upper right-hand corner of Task Objects. If the Index number does not appear, please select the pull-down menu **View - Redraw Rebuild Menues**.
