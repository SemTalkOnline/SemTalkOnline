**Business Process Gateway - Vocabulary - State**: Business Process Diagrams **Gateways** are branches in Task flows that determine what happens based on the State of the Object in the Gateway. For example a **Denied** (State = Denied) Offer (an Object) is sent to the Task 'Send Offer Denial Letter'. If the offer is **Approved** (State = Approved), it is sent further along in the workflow. 

**Example of States**:
* Approved
* Complete
* Denied
* In Process
* In Review
* Invoice necessary
* Delivered
* Found
* Invoiced
* in Process
* Received
* Draft
* New
* Reviewed
