SemTalk Online requires a UserID (user's e-mail address) and a password. If you already have an account, select your User Type and login. When SemTalk opens, either your last used model will appear or a new model will open that corresponds to the model type used the last time you logged in. Unless instructed to access a specific customized Database, leave ‘Default’  as your Database.  If you have been instructed to access a particular Database, select the Database from the Database pull-down menu. 

If you forgot your login password, enter your email address and select the Resend Password option and you will be sent a temporary new password. After you login, go to the Tools - User pull-down menu and create a new password.

SemTalk Options are based on your selected role.

**SemTalk Roles:**

**Reader**: Readers are able to view the model but they are not allowed to Edit the content.

**Editor:** Normal modelers generally use the Editor role. It provides the functionality needed to create and format SemTalk models.

**Administrator:** This role has all of the Editor permissions plus the ability to customize the modelling options and it has administrative capabilities to manage users (including assigning roles). Administrators can only be appointed by other administrators.

**MetaModel Editor:** Is able to Edit the model as well as customize the metamodel to fit orgniztional requirements. MetaModel editors should have a deep knowledge of SemTalk metamodels and notational components.

**Publishe**r: This role is able to publish process models for process portals.

The **Connection** button can be used to specify another (own) MongoDB server. This way you can also access your own databases via the SemTalk Online application.
