**Getting Started with SemTalk**

**Adding Objects to Diagrams**

![alt text](images/Semtalk-Overview.png)

Every model requires a workspace on which to model. In SemTalk, these workspaces are referred to as Diagrams. SemTalk simplifies the modeling process by creating modeling workspaces that have the rules built into the modeling environment. The number and type of Diagrams, as well as the modeling rules, correspond to each of the standard SemTalk versions.  Each time you open a SemTalk version, whether it is BPMN, EPCs or any customized version type, you are opening a worksheet that comes with a built-in rule-based engine that will only allows you to model what is allowed in the version you have selected.  

When you open SemTalk, you will see a stencil window pane labeled 'Stencil' that contains various graphical Object types. The objects shown are the Object types available for the current Diagram (workspace). Generally, the default Diagram with be the Diagram that shows the core process flows for the method in use (e.g. Business Process Diagram if you are using the BPML Version).  
 
Just drag and drop Objects from your stencil onto the Diagram to represent your process flow. Name your Object by double clicking on the Object or right-mouse click on your object, select Properties and add your name in Task. Connect Objects by hovering your cursor over the Object name until you see a hand over your Object name. Then hold down your cursor and draw the connection to the next object. Just as the available Objects are rule-based, the type of connections allowed are also restricted by the chosen version. Here is it more flexible to assign different connectors if needed. 

Since processes scenarios represent a specific sequence of events, on each object there is an auto-draw feature for you to choose the next object. When you used this feature, the connection will be made automatically.

**Naming Objects**

In addition to the two Object naming options - double-click and the Properties dialog, SemTalk is able to create structured naming conventions. Almost all processes (work-steps) have names that consist of a verb and a noun. For example, the process step 'Send Invoice' is the verb 'Send' and the noun 'Invoice'. SemTalk allows users to create libraries of these verbs and nouns so that all modeling projects remain consistent; interfaces that define information flows remain consistent; and so that central repositories of terms can be created that allow modelers to import/ export key data terms to and from these libraries.

Right-mouse click on a new Task and select Vocabulary.

A Vocabulary Window will open. If a Repository is associated with the SemTalk version you have installed, or the model you currently have open, a pull-down menu for Objects (Nouns) and Methods (Verbs).
