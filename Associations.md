# Associations

![alt text](images/Explorer_AssociationsNEW.png)

**Explorer Associations**: Users can navigate to different Association types located in the model to **Edit, Add or Delete the Properties** of each **Association Type** or to add their own **User-Defined Associations**. 

**Associations - General - Properties**

**System-Defined Associations** are built according to the rules of the selected **SemTalk Online Methodology**. The basic structure of these **Associations** is fixed but certain settings can be set by model **Administrators** as needed (e.g. Comments, Hyperlinks etc.).

**NOTE**: **User-Defined Associations** can be created but models may lose essential **Reporting** and **Simulation** capabilities so we strongly recommend using **SemTalk Online's default Associations** settings.
