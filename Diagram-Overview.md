# Diagram Overview

In SemTalk Online, modeling workspaces are referred to as **Diagrams**. Each **Diagram Type** in a model has built-in **Rules**. 

The number and type of **Diagrams** correspond to each of the standard SemTalk versions.  Each SemTalk version, whether it is **BPMN**, **EPCs** or any customized version, opens a set of **Diagrams**. Each Diagram type has its own built-in rule-based engine that only allows the applicable **Objects** and **Associations**  to the selected. User-defined Diagram types can also be created, but reporting and other functions may be limited without additional customization.

**BPMN** and **EPCs** process flow **Diagrams** are the active modeling space where modelers add worksteps and information flows to create the scenarios used to represent process flows.

### BPMN Diagram Types:
* Business Process Diagrams
* Object Diagram
* Ontology
* OrgChart

### EPC Diagram Types:
* Buffer Model
* eEPC
* Knowledge Map
* Object Model
* OrgChart
* PhysResource Model
