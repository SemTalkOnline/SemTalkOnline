**File Open**: Opens a directory of available Models with their CheckIn/ CheckOut status. If you open a model that is checked out by another user, you will see a red error message next to the model name in your explorer stating that the model is checked out to <user x>. You can use the Save As command to create a new version or, if you are a model Administrator, you can check the model back in.

Available files are stored locally, on your **Computer** or available online files are located by selecting **Database**. When selecting Database models, SemTalk automatically updates associated data such as the date last **Modified**, the last author in **ModifiedBy** and the **CheckOut** status.
