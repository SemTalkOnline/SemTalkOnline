New: Creates a New Diagram. 
Select Diagram Type:
* Business Process Diagram: Shows process/ workflows
* Object Diagram: Shows object names and the relationship between named objects. These Diagrams can be used to show the UML class view of objects. (Methods are not standard UML in that they are simply names for activities, not the underlying code.)
* Ontology: This feature allows customization of model content to create formal names and categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities by domain
* OrgChart: Shows the people and groups who perform tasks.

Delete: Deletes the diagram that is currently being displayed

Reindex: This Reindex option allows the user to change which pages the diagrams appear on

Go Up: If there is some refinment within the diagram it will go from the more detailed refinement back to the original diagram

Insert (Model): This allows for models (such as tasks, objects, events, etc.) that are in the local repository to be put into any diagram or sub diagram in the Business Process Diagram

Paste: Paste what was copied or cut
